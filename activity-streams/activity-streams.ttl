   skos:definition "Indicates that the actor has consumed the object. The specific meaning is dependent largely on the objects type. For instance, an actor may consume an audio object, indicating that the actor has listened to it; or an actor may consume a book, indicating that the book has been read. As such, the consume verb is a more generic form of other more specific verbs such as read and play."@en;

This object is intended primarily for use in micro-blogging scenarios and in systems where users are invited to publish short, often plain-text messages whose useful lifespan is generally shorter than that of an article of weblog entry. A note is similar in structure to an article, but typically does not have a title or distinct paragraphs and tends to be much shorter in length."@en;
